## ðŸ“¤ CSV Export

Each monthly entry is automatically saved to a file named `expense_report.csv`  
This can be analyzed later in **Excel** or **Python (pandas, matplotlib)**.

Example format:

```csv
Year,Month,Salary,CarryForward,TotalBudget,TotalExpense,MonthlySavings
2024,January,30000,0,30000,20000,10000
2024,February,28000,10000,38000,16000,22000
